    "### Scope of Notebook\n",
    "This notebook will build on the [previous analysis example](https://github.com/cfpb/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit/blob/master/analysis_examples/1.%20Plotting%20a%20Time%20Series%20of%20HMDA%20Filers%20from%202004-2017.ipynb) of counting the number of institutions that have filed HMDA data from 2004-2017, by demonstrating how to filter counts by a particular category. The code below will focus on counts taken from the Transmittal Sheet dataset inside the HMDA collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example will show how to pull Transmittal Sheet data from a local Postgres database, filter by a particular category, write the data to a pipe-delimited text file, and produce a graph in the Jupyter notebook as well as save the graph to a .png file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, more advanced methods using functions will be shown as an introduction to a library of functions that can be used to interact with the HMDA data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these examples provide some commentary on the use of SQL and Python, they should not be considered a replacement for more full fledged tutorials on how to use these tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Requirements\n",
    "In order to run this example locally several software packages need to be installed and configured. \n",
    "Please see [these instructions](https://github.com/Kibrael/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit#creating-postgres-tables-and-loading-data) to get a local Postgres database set up and populated with HMDA data. \n",
    "Please see [these instructions](https://github.com/Kibrael/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit#requirements) for setting up a Python development environment. Python 3.5 or higher is required as well as several libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Libraries Used\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/): a data manipulation and analysis package.\n",
    "- [Psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/): a database driver library providing APIs for connecting Python to Postgres.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): a library to enable inline plotting with Pandas and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/documentation): a development tool that supports multiple formats for display such as Markdown and Python. Allows segmentation of code into cells for easy data manipulation trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "This notebook will leverage Postgres SQL as a data store and aggregation tool. Python will be used to interact with the database through the Psycopg2 library. The Pandas library will be used for data handling after pulling from Postgres. This includes cleaning, analysis, and visualization with the Matplotlib library (which integrates with Pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "The procss for this analysis will be:\n",
    "- Establish a connection to the database using psycopg2\n",
    "- Call a SQL file through Python to pull Transmittal Sheet counts by year\n",
    "- Filter by a particular category\n",
    "- Load the data into a Pandas dataframe\n",
    "- Graph the data in the Jupyter notebook and save the graph to a .PNG file"
